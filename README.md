# Kubewarden policy env-variable-secrets-scanner-policy

This policy will reject pods that contain a secret in an environment variable
in any container. It scans environment variables in all containers, init
containers and ephemeral containers. The policy can detect secrets that are
leaked via base64 encoded variables. The policy looks for the following secrets
being leaked: RSA private keys, SSH private keys and API tokens for different
services like Slack, Facebook tokens, AWS, Google, New Relic Keys, etc.

This policy is powered by the same rule engine used by [rusty
hog](https://github.com/newrelic/rusty-hog), an open source secret scanner from
New Relic.

The policy can either target `Pods`, or [workload
resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) (`Deployments`,
`ReplicaSets`, `DaemonSets`, `ReplicationControllers`, `Jobs`, `CronJobs`) by
setting the policy's `spec.rules` accordingly.

Both have trade-offs:

- Policy targets Pods: Different kind of resources (be them native or CRDs) can
  create Pods. By having the policy target Pods, we guarantee that all the Pods
  are going to be compliant, even those created from CRDs.
  However, this could lead to confusion among users, as high level Kubernetes
  resources would be successfully created, but they would stay in a non
  reconciled state. Example: a Deployment creating a non-compliant Pod would be
  created, but it would never have all its replicas running.
- Policy targets workload resources (e.g: Deployment): the policy inspect higher
  order resource (e.g. Deployment): users will get immediate feedback about
  rejections.
  However, non compliant pods created by another high level resource (be it
  native to Kubernetes, or a CRD), may not get rejected.

> [!WARNING]  
> Some users reported
> [issues](https://github.com/kubewarden/env-variable-secrets-scanner-policy/issues/102)
> with this policy where the policy server halts its execution due to the time
> it takes to process the resources. This occurs more frequently under a high
> volume of requests or in resource-constrained environments. This happens
> because the library used by the policy to scan for secrets is not fast
> enough.
>
> To work around this issue, users can deploy this policy on a dedicated policy
> server where the execution timeout is increased or even disabled. Check our
> [documentation](https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/policy-evaluation-timeout)
> on how to change this configuration.
